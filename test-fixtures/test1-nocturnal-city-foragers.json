      "description": "A dense, rain-slicked city of layered infrastructure — elevated walkways, flooded lower districts, flickering signage. The powerful live in the upper grid. Everything below belongs to the night. No names for neighborhoods; locals call the zones by what falls there: 'the glass level,' 'the rot,' 'the wire.'",

      "visual_language": "Masked faces, ringed eyes, hands always in motion. Boxy architectural forms. Pools of amber streetlight against deep blue shadow. Everything useful has been repurposed. Nothing is wasted."
