Characters read small but weighty — chunky proportion, not tall. Flat bold color palette, no gradients. Swap the glasses, change the person — glasses are the identity primitive. Characters read as civic, earnest, slightly absurd. Trademark risk medium: use the visual primitives, not 'Nouns' as an in-world proper noun."

Palette is rust, moss, and murk: desaturated greens and browns, nothing clean. Characters are tricksters and survivors, not heroes. Environment reads wet, marginal, liminal. Pepe adjacency is in the visual lineage — never name or reference the meme directly, but do not pretend the lineage isn't there."

Clothing is the character differentiation — hoodies, hats, accessories drawn in the same flat line weight as the body. Desaturated streetwear palette: greys, washed blacks, muted color pops. Skate and streetwear culture, ironic detachment, anti-heroic. Governance ambiguity: Sartoshi's CC0 declaration predates his exit — medium confidence, not high. Always cite accordingly."

Burn-to-evolve mechanic: v0 tokens (photographic real raccoons, naturalistic close-up portraits, rich fur texture, black facial mask dominant, amber eye-shine, earthy and grounded) burn to become v1 tokens. V1 is raCC0on World — stylized humanoid raccoons organized by life stage: Baby, Toddler, Teen, Adult, Midlife, Old Wise. V1 visual grammar: rounded soft forms, bold outlines, warm storybook illustration style, flat color backgrounds. Clothing signals life stage — hoodie for teen, tie for adult, flannel for old wise. Domestic and cozy, not scavenger punk. The transformation from wild animal (v0) to settled humanoid (v1) is the arc. Characters are defined by where they are in life, not what they carry. High confidence CC0 — no ambiguity on either version."

      "notes": "Digital glitch art: fragmented figures rendered in high-contrast palette — neon against void, signal against static. Forms feel corrupted mid-transmission: skull motifs, hollow eyes, screaming mouths frozen open. No continuous line work — images read as artifacts, as if the file is decaying while you watch. Palette runs black and white as base with single aggressive color injection: acid green, hot pink, emergency red. Death, screens, and commodity culture are the recurring themes — characters are witnesses, not actors. Emotional register is flat affect over dread: no sentimentality, no resolution. CC0 explicitly declared by XCOPYART (Twitter, Aug 1 2022) for all existing and future solo non-collaborative works. Trademark risk medium: use the visual grammar (glitch, fragmentation, decay), not 'XCOPY' as an in-world proper noun."

The items are the world: 'Grimoire,' 'Holy Chestplate of the Fox,' 'Dragon's Crown of Skill.' No character, no art, no lore — the model must generate all of it from the item names alone. Aesthetic is maximalist noun-stacking in minimal form. The community interprets Loot as CC0 based on intentional omission of lore ('left for others to interpret') and a permissive FAQ. No formal CC0 declaration exists from dom hofmann. Medium confidence — treat as CC0 in practice, surface the flag in compliance manifests."

      "notes": "16-color pixel art, strict palette constraint — each piece uses exactly four colors pulled from a family palette. Hard edges only: no gradients, no anti-aliasing, no dithering. Characters and scenes are small and dense, rendered in retro game aesthetic with surrealist subject matter — cosmic, pastoral, military, absurd in equal measure. The palette IS the identity: a Blitmap character is visually locked to its four colors, which defines mood and kinship more than form does. Compositions read flat and bold, like a cartridge label or arcade screen. CC0 declared by dom Hofmann at launch. Low trademark risk — the constraint system is the signature, not a name or logo."

      "notes": "Fully on-chain generative ASCII art — characters composed entirely of typographic symbols (pipes, slashes, dots, plus signs) arranged by algorithm into dense symmetrical patterns. No figurative representation, no color, no gradients. Visual grammar is structural: radial symmetry, repetition, density variation, negative space. If referenced in a world, Autoglyphs entities are beings of pure pattern — mathematical, sigil-like, form-as-function. They do not have faces or bodies; they have geometries. The oldest on-chain generative art project, which makes them the direct ancestor of everything Worldkit is building toward. CC0 declared by Larva Labs. Low trademark risk — the visual output is the asset, not a brand mark."
