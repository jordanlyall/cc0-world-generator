      "notes": "Blocky pixel-art humanoids: large rectangular head, oversized colored glasses as the defining trait, boxy torso, stubby limbs. Characters read small but weighty — chunky proportion, not tall. Flat bold color palette, no gradients. Swap the glasses, change the person — glasses are the identity primitive. Characters read as civic, earnest, slightly absurd. Trademark risk medium: use the visual primitives, not 'Nouns' as an in-world proper noun."

      "notes": "Squat amphibian humanoids: wide flat heads, large eyes, mottled green-grey skin, hunched posture. Swamp and decay aesthetic — tattered clothing, found objects. Palette is rust, moss, and murk: desaturated greens and browns, nothing clean. Characters are tricksters and survivors, not heroes. Environment reads wet, marginal, liminal. Pepe adjacency is in the visual lineage — never name or reference the meme directly, but do not pretend the lineage isn't there."

      "notes": "Minimal stick-figure humanoids: circle head, single-line body, simple limb geometry. No face detail beyond an occasional cigarette. Clothing is the character differentiation — hoodies, hats, accessories drawn in the same flat line weight as the body. Desaturated streetwear palette: greys, washed blacks, muted color pops. Skate and streetwear culture, ironic detachment, anti-heroic. Governance ambiguity: Sartoshi's CC0 declaration predates his exit — medium confidence, not high. Always cite accordingly."

Earth tones and shadow palette — deep charcoal, warm brown, occasional flash of amber or green eye-shine. Characters are nocturnal, opportunistic, highly adaptable — trickster-adjacent but pragmatic rather than chaotic. Scavenger aesthetic: repurposed materials, jury-rigged gear, nothing wasted. High confidence — no ambiguity."
