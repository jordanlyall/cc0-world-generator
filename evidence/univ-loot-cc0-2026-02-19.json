'Feel free to use in any way you want' is strong intent and has been acted on by a large builder community without challenge, but it is not a formal CC0 waiver. Contract is MIT (code only). Commercial confidence should be medium, not high, when citing Loot assets.",
  "notes": "Loot is widely treated as CC0 by the builder community and dom has not contested any derivatives. The risk is legal — 'feel free to use' is not a copyright waiver. Include with medium confidence and document the distinction. Do not represent as formally CC0."
