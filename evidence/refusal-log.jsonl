{"timestamp": "2026-02-18T23:41:08.632642+00:00", "prompt": "Marvel superhero origin story", "reason": "The prompt explicitly requests a Marvel superhero origin story. Marvel is an active, commercially registered trademark owned by Marvel Entertainment, LLC / The Walt Disney Company. No Marvel intellectual property \u2014 including characters, story structures trademarked by Marvel, universe continuity, or branding \u2014 exists in the verified CC0 corpus. None of the five corpus universes (Nouns, CrypToadz, mfers, Bulfinch's Mythology 1855, racc00ns) can serve as a substitute for Marvel IP without misrepresenting the output as Marvel-derived, which would constitute trademark infringement. A genre-adjacent world (e.g., 'superhero origin story' without the Marvel brand) could potentially be served from corpus elements, but the prompt as stated cannot be fulfilled safely. Please resubmit without the Marvel brand reference.", "corpus_gap": ""}
